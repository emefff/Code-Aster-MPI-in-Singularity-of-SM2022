In the following tutorial we will show how to build the MPI Version of Code Aster 16.4 within the Singularity Container of Salome-Meca 2022. Many thanks to forum member EnKiNekiDela, who describes very clearly how to build the MPI version in his own Github repository at https://github.com/bursica/Code_Aster-MPI-in-Singularity-of-SM2022. However, in the recipe below a slightly different approach is shown.
Compared to our old recipe (there we downloaded a .zip of CA source code), this time we will download the Code_Aster Gitlab repository as a whole and choose the version in the code. Basically, this way we are able to even choose another version of Code_Aster (though with some restrictions regarding the chosen Salome-Meca .sif container. For info on which container to use for which CA version see https://gitlab.com/codeaster-opensource-documentation/opensource-installation-development/-/blob/main/devel/changelog.md). In the description below we will choose Code_Aster 16.4 which is a testing, rather than a stable version. The latest stable version as of writing these lines is 15.6, which is quite close to 15.4 in the SM2021 repository (https://github.com/emefff/Code-Aster-MPI-in-Singularity-of-SM2021). A big thanks of course goes to EDF's R&D-Team, the developers of Salome-Meca and Code_Aster üëç. 

This recipe and the resulting container were tested in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Please be aware, that some slight modifications might be necessary when using Ubuntu 22.04LTS (see Code_Aster forum https://code-aster.org/V2/spip.php?rubrique2 for these known issues).
________________________________________________________________________________________________________

If you do not have singularity installed, the version coming with Ubuntu 22.04LTS is fine.

`sudo apt-get install singularity`

To check the installed version 

`singularity --version`

The version used here was 'singularity-ce version 3.10.3-focal', the 'focal' hints it is the version provided by Ubuntu repositories.
If you want to compile singularity yourself, please refer to https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/blob/main/INSTALL.md.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Download the necessary Singularity Container of Salome-Meca 2022 with 

`wget -c https://www.code-aster.org/FICHIERS/singularity/salome_meca-lgpl-2022.1.0-1-20221225-scibian-9.sif`

and place it in your home folder ~/ (also $HOME). The file size should be approx. 6.2GB. 

Alternatively, the container can be downloaded directly from the page https://code-aster.org/V2/spip.php?article303, however, we recommend using wget -c.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Now we will download the Code_Aster repository from Gitlab. Some of the below instructions can be found here: https://gitlab.com/codeaster-opensource-documentation/opensource-installation-development/-/blob/main/devel/compile.md#preparing-the-access-to-the-container but not all of them are necessary.

First we will create a folder for the Code_Aster repository with

`mkdir -p $HOME/dev/codeaster`

We clone the whole repository with

```
cd $HOME/dev/codeaster
git clone https://gitlab.com/codeaster/src.git
git clone https://gitlab.com/codeaster/devtools.git
```
This could take`
